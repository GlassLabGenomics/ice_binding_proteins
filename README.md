# Ice Binding Proteins (IBP) Project
This is a repository of scripts, documentation, and results for the computational part of the ice binding protein (IBP) project: **_Cold tolerance in the intertidal zone_**.

## Aims

Our immediate goal is to develop a comprehensive screening method to reliably identify IBPs and provide information on their functional mechanisms, evolutionary history and ecological roles in Arctic and subarctic
intertidal invertebrates. From the intertidal invertebrates, we search for IBPs in two target species of sea stars, _Asterias amurensis_ (Northern Pacific seastar) and _Pisaster ochraceus_ (Ochre seastars), with the aim to expand to _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ and potentially other inverts. We are developing the screening method from two directions: a screening pipeline algorithm coupled with ice-binding assays, a design that relies on interplay between computational and experimental techniques to extract a true ice-binding signal. The computational step combs through current sequence and structure databases in search of proteins containing ice-binding motifs and organisms that produce these proteins, and the experimental step verifies if ice-binding activity indeed occurs.

Our overall goal is to produce and test a method that can verify IBP existence and activity, and reliably predict novel IBPs.

## Main questions

There are two main questions we try to answer computationally:

1. Which classes of IBPs are found in intertidal invertebrates and from which lineages do they arise?
2. What structures do the IBPs adopt and how do they impact function?
